# Graph-Of-Thought

This project introduces the **Graph-of-Thought (GoT) Reasoning Engine**, a system designed to externalize reasoning as an **explicit graph structure**, composed of conceptual nodes and typed relational edges. The central hypothesis is that **reasoning is more faithfully represented as a graph than as a sequence**, particularly for complex, evolving, and multi-constraint problem spaces encountered in real human cognition.
